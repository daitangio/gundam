A set of project based on my experience as Java Solution Architect.


The project are stored as git submodule
Git doesn't track files inside the submodule when you're in the parent repository, it just sees it as a single file.

To download the submodule issue
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
git submodule status
```
