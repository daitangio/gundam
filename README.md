A set of project based on my experience @ NttData Italy as Solution Architect


The project are stored as git submodule
Git doesn't track files inside the submodule when you're in the parent repository, it just sees it as a single file.

To download the submodule issue
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
git submodule status
```
